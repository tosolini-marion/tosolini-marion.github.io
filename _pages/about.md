Welcome to my personal website!

I am a PhD student in Economics at the University of Lorraine (Nancy) in France.


[Bureau d'Economie théorique et appliquée](https://www.beta-economics.fr/)



My [research](/research/) deals with the history of the European borrowing policies from the 1950s to the 1990s.



I am also member of the editorial board of [Regards croisés sur l'économie](https://rce-revue.com/).
