The history of the borrowing policies of the European Communities is under-studied. For my PhD research, I have created dabase on the borrowing operations of the European Communities. 
Using the Financial Reports of the European Communities, I reported the core information of borrowing operations: amounts, maturity, interest rates, currency. These data will be available soon. 

In the meantime, you can find some descriptive statistics in the sub-sections of the research page ([the ECSC](/research/ecsc/), [the EEC](/research/eec/)).
