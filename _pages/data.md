The history of the borrowing policies of the European Communities is under-studied. For my PhD research, I have created dabase on the borrowing operations of the European Communities. 
Using the Financial Reports of the European Communities, I reported the core information of borrowing operations: amounts, maturity, interest rates, currency.

Data are available [here](https://entrepot.recherche.data.gouv.fr/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.57745/WCQGTD)

You can also find some descriptive statistics in the sub-sections of the research page ([the ECSC](/research/ecsc/), [the EEC](/research/eec/)).
