Following the economic consequences of the first oil shock, the EEC Commission and its Member States agreed to implement a financial assistance to member states. Through the Community Loan Mechanism, the EEC Commission was empowered to borrow from the financial markets in order to grant loans to member states facing balance of payments deficits due to the oil shock. In this [article](https://journals.openedition.org/ei/8044), you can find [here](https://journals.openedition.org/ei/docannexe/image/8044/img-2.png) every borrowing operation made by the Commission for the CLM between 1976 and 1993.
